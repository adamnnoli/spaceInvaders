Multiple Waves
I added multiple waves to the game by creating a new wave object when the
player won the game. I added an attribute called _round to Invaders to keep
track of the round number the player was on so I knew whether to give the
player another life for surviving each round and how many times the speed
needed to be multiplied each round. 


Sound Effects
I added sound effects by created sound objects in wave and assigning them to
attributes. I then played the sounds each time a bolt was fired or an alien or ship died.

Dynamically Sped Up Aliens
I sped up the aliens each time one was killed by multiplying the _alienspeed
attribute by a factor in consts in the helper method which checks if an alien
has been killed

Keeping Track of Score
I kept track of score by added two attributes in Invaders, one to hold the
score value and one to hold the object that was displayed in the game. I also
added an attribute in wave to keep track of the score in the round there. I then
used a getter to send that information to Invaders which displayed it to the game view
